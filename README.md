# Laboratory Experiment Management System (LEMS)

## ðŸŒ± Project Overview
The **Laboratory Experiment Management System (LEMS)** was developed for **BioSphere Innovations Ltd.** to manage and consolidate research activities conducted across laboratories in the UK, Lithuania, and India. The project aims to replace analog and fragmented digital processes with a unified infrastructure that tracks the effects of chemical and biological samples on plants.
